- Paging support.
  A generic paging interface should be implemented to display contents
  that need to be displayed in more than one pages. (Search results,
  recent changes, etc.)

- New path types.
  Despite ALIW API allows more than one path type to be introduced,
  there is currently a single path type, `page'. There should be some
  other built-in path types (e.g. `image' and `file') in the
  ecosystem.

- E-mail validation mechanism for new accounts.

- Hierarchical user/group management.

- Edit notification system.
  Users that are subscribed to a certain page will get notified by the
  modifications done to that page.
